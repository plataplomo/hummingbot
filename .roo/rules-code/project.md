# Project Context: CyberDeltaEngine

1.  **Project Name:** The project is **CyberDeltaEngine**. Use this name consistently in documentation and code where appropriate (e.g., module names, class prefixes if applicable, logging identifiers).

2.  **Core Domain:** This is an **automated, asynchronous (asyncio-based) Python trading engine**. Its primary function is executing **delta-neutral arbitrage strategies**, initially focusing on **funding rate arbitrage** between **Hyperliquid perpetuals** and **Backpack perpetuals** (v0.0.1 target, subject to validation).

3.  **Criticality:** Assume this system will eventually handle **real financial assets**. Therefore, prioritize **robustness, security, correctness, comprehensive error handling, and extensive testing** above cleverness or premature optimization in all code generation, analysis, and recommendations. Assume failure modes are common and must be handled gracefully.

4.  **Future Scope (Informational Only):** While the current focus is narrow, be aware the architecture aims for future extensibility towards multiple exchanges, diverse strategies (including statistical arbitrage and potential AI/ML models), and enhanced monitoring/analysis. Current design decisions should facilitate this where practical *without* adding unnecessary complexity to the prototype.
