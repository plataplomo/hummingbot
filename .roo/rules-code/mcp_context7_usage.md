# Rule Name: **Context7_Proactive_Integration_For_You**

## Description
To ensure **your** responses are consistently accurate, up-to-date, and deeply context-aware, **you** are empowered and expected to **proactively** utilize the Context7 system. The Context7 system leverages a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** approach, providing essential structured context for technical details, project specifics, and best practices. Explicit user commands to `use context7` remain available for guaranteed activation by the user.

## Core Principle
**Your** default operational mode should be to consult the Context7 system for any query where project-specific, technical, or internal documentation context could enhance the quality, accuracy, or relevance of **your** response. The benefits of fresh, accurate context are paramount.

## Your Proactive Usage Guidelines
**You should automatically integrate Context7 processing** when:

*   The query references known project names, internal tools, proprietary APIs, codebase specifics, or team-specific terminology.
*   The query pertains to implementation details, architectural decisions, or established best practices within our defined technology stack and internal standards.
*   The user is seeking troubleshooting assistance related to our systems or projects.
*   The query seeks information likely to be documented within our internal knowledge bases, Confluence, wikis, or other repositories indexed by Context7.
*   The conversational history strongly indicates a discussion rooted in our project's context.

**You** may only bypass Context7 if a query is unequivocally for general, non-project-related knowledge (e.g., "What is a Fibonacci sequence?" in a context clearly unrelated to our work) AND **you** have a compelling reason to believe Context7 would offer no relevant enhancement. **When in doubt, you must use Context7.**

## Explicit User Trigger
Team members can always ensure **you** integrate Context7 by appending the exact phrase:
`use context7`
to their question or prompt. This will override **your** decision not to use it.

## Scope
This applies to **your** interactions concerning:
*   Code implementation, APIs, SDKs, libraries, or architectural decisions where our specific project context is vital.
*   Project-specific documentation, standards, historical decisions, or established patterns.
*   Current best practices as they apply within our technical environment.
*   Troubleshooting complex issues where deep, contextual understanding is beneficial.
*   Any situation where **your** responses benefit from high-fidelity, structured context beyond general knowledge.

## Your Responsibility
*   **Proactively** identify queries that would benefit from Context7 based on the guidelines above and automatically integrate it.
*   **Always** prioritize Context7 processing when the user explicitly gives the `use context7` command.
*   Aim to provide responses enriched by the fresh, accurate context from Context7.

## Rationale
The Context7 system, by employing principles aligned with a Model Context Protocol (MCP), provides superior structured context for **you** to use. **Your** proactive and frequent use of Context7 ensures **your** responses are consistently grounded in the latest project information and technical realities. This significantly enhances **your** precision, minimizes ambiguity, and maximizes the reliability and utility of **your** assistance, justifying its use even if a slight processing overhead is incurred. Fresh context is critical for **you**.

## Examples

*   **Your Proactive Usage (Expected):**
    *   User: "How do we handle authentication in the `phoenix-gateway` service?"
    *   **You (internally):** *Identify `phoenix-gateway` as a project-specific term, automatically route query via Context7.*
    *   **Your Response:** "According to our latest guidelines for `phoenix-gateway` (sourced via Context7), authentication is handled by..."

*   **Explicit User Trigger:**
    *   User: "What are the general principles of REST API design? `use context7`"
    *   **You (internally):** *See `use context7`, route query via Context7 to check for any internal best practices or deviations.*
    *   **Your Response:** "Leveraging Context7, our specific guidelines for REST API design emphasize..." or "Context7 indicates we generally follow standard REST principles, such as..."

## Your Workflow

1.  **Receive & Analyze Prompt:**
    *   Check for the explicit `use context7` command from the user.
    *   If not present, analyze the query content, conversational history, and keywords against **Your Proactive Usage Guidelines** to determine if Context7 is beneficial for **you** to use.
2.  **Prioritize Context7 System Processing:**
    *   If the explicit command is present OR if **your** proactive guidelines indicate its use, formulate the core query.
    *   Route this core query for processing by the Context7 system.
3.  **Receive & Process Context7-Enhanced Input:** Obtain the structured context or direct answer from the Context7 system.
4.  **Synthesize & Deliver Answer:** Utilize the Context7-provided information to generate **your** final answer.
5.  **Indicate Source (Recommended):** Where appropriate, acknowledge **your** use of Context7 (e.g., "Based on Context7 information...", "Our documentation via Context7 states...").

## Considerations & Best Practices for You

*   **Continuous Improvement:** **Your** ability to proactively identify when to use Context7 should be an area for ongoing tuning and improvement in **your** programming.
*   **Feedback Loop:** If **you** fail to use Context7 when **you** should have, or use it unnecessarily (though the latter is less of a concern given the "always fresh context" preference), team members should provide feedback if mechanisms exist to refine **your** decision-making.
*   **Understanding Your Default:** Team members should understand that **you** are designed to default to using Context7 for relevant queries, making explicit commands less frequently needed but still available.
